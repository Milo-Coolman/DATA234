## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

pres_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highamm/ds234_quarto/main/data_online/pres2000.csv") 
head(pres_df)

ggplot(data = pres_df, aes(x = Bush)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "darkred", bins = 15) +
  labs(x = "Votes for Bush in Florida")

ggplot(data = pres_df, aes(x = Buchanan, y = Bush)) +
  geom_point()
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
