Blonde,Devotion,The Lost Abbey,The Lost Abbey Devotion Ale,"Notes:Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.\t",6,15,30,31,33,10,74,45,49,4,72,112,38,63,3.822134,3.970356,3.816206,3.875494,3.964427

The beer is a very deep/dark color of brown with a nice creamy tan head. The mouthfeel of the beer is very soft and is very drinkable. Flavors of malt, caramel, toffee, and a mild earthy nutty finish allow this beer to be paired with hearty food and sips of bourbon.\t",7,15,25,11,80,18,60,66,4,0,9,56,8,130,3.832,3.776,3.716,3.876,3.848

So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU\t",5.9,35,60,17,31,13,74,35,31,0,39,110,8,61,3.564855,3.691937,3.589395,3.605171,3.829097

Lager,Lager,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Lager,"Notes:In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.\t",5.2,18,30,20,27,4,65,34,19,0,23,86,3,72,3.726158,3.891916,3.751589,3.864668,4.024977

Lager,Asahi Super Dry,Asahi Breweries Ltd,Asahi Breweries Ltd Asahi Super Dry,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.

Lager,Zeppelin Bier,Brauerei Max Leibinger GmbH,Brauerei Max Leibinger GmbH Zeppelin Bier,"Notes:Our Zeppelin Beer is a so-called ""Kellerbier"". The name ""Kellerbier"" has historical roots, dating back to the time when beer was still served directly from the cellar. It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.\t",5.2,20,40,13,52,18,36,71,21,0,32,52,9,117,3.368421,3.736842,3.763158,3.526316,3.684211

Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery.

Porter,The Big Smoke,8 Wired Brewing Co.,8 Wired Brewing Co. The Big Smoke,"Notes:Now what is this? A smoked beer?? It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.40 IBU\t",6.2,20,40,19,104,18,60,89,25,0,28,37,118,133,4,4.0625,3.765625,3.78125,3.828125

Stout,Black Chocolate Stout,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.\t",10,50,90,12,107,34,45,82,7,0,6,30,10,111,4.110544,4.293829,4.165304,4.220883,4.032284

This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well.

Wheat,UFO Hefeweizen,Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Brewery UFO Hefeweizen,"Notes:UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU\t",4.8,10,35,9,36,4,16,25,54,0,71,25,27,80,3.27371,3.578203,3.416805,3.352745,3.648087

Wheat,West Coast Wheat Wine,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom West Coast Wheat Wine,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.\t",10.5,45,85,18,45,33,37,96,63,0,81,32,7,70,3.791667,3.75,3.791667,3.666667,3.791667

Wheat,Positive Contact,Dogfish Head Brewery,Dogfish Head Brewery Positive Contact,"Notes:Positive Contact is the second batch of the Imperial Belgian-Style Wheat beer that Sam and Ben brewed a couple months back. For this batch, we stepped up the spice and cider additions. Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1.Overall, Positive Contact is characterized by its bright spritzy cider character and autumnal herbal quality derived from the cilantro, cayenne, and yeast.19 IBU\t",9,10,20,31,30,30,10,82,93,0,96,57,79,35,3.5,2.75,3,3.75,3.75

Wheat,Two Jokers Double-Wit,Boulevard Brewing Co.,Boulevard Brewing Co. Two Jokers Double-Wit,"Notes:They say there are two sides to every story, and that’s certainly true of Two Jokers Double-Wit. On the one hand, it’s a revival of the classic Belgian “wit,” or “white” ale, with lactic fermentation providing a refreshing tartness. On the other hand, it’s a modern, uniquely American brew; big, flavorful, and spiced with cardamom, coriander, orange peel, lavender, and grains of paradise.15 IBU\t",8,10,20,22,50,18,25,58,157,3,116,55,67,64,4.003185,4.047771,4,4.070064,4.031847

Wheat,Wheat Ale,Upland Brewing Company,Upland Brewing Company Wheat Ale,"Notes:Upland Wheat Ale is a classic rendition of the Belgian Witbier (white beer) style. We brew it with organic coriander and orange zest to be light on the tongue and refreshingly tart. In the tradition of the Belgian Wit style, Upland Wheat Ale is unfiltered, allowing suspended yeast to create a cloudy, golden appearance. This is an everyday, every meal type of beer. It’s comforting on a cold winter day and refreshing on a hot summer evening. That’s why it’s one of our most popular brews and a flagship beer of our brewery.\t",4.5,10,20,21,32,14,15,25,71,0,78,33,38,77,3.496,3.496,3.556,3.524,3.876
