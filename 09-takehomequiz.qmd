# Question 1
a) 30 rows because there are 6 rows for each of the 5 squash players in major_df
b) 28 rows because there are 28 people in major_df who are not in ds234_df
c) 107 rows we keep all 72 rows of match_df + 35 rows for the 35 non squash players in major_df
d) 18 rows because there are 3 squash players in ds234_df and they each have 6 rows in match_df
e) 42 rows because we keep all 27 in df234_df and add 5 rows for each of the 3 squash players.

# Question 2
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(514131)
stat213_df <- tibble(name = c("Kaiya", "Evan", "Tommy", 
                              "Andrew", "Cam", "Clayton", "Lyla"),
                     gpa = sample(seq(2, 4, by = 0.25), 7, replace = FALSE))

stat234_df <- tibble(name = c("Evan", "Mitchell", "Nick", 
                              "Clayton", "Ella", "Haley"),
                     gpa = sample(seq(2, 4, by = 0.25), 6, replace = FALSE))
stat213_df
stat234_df

inner_join(stat213_df, stat234_df, by = join_by(name))

anti_join(stat213_df, stat234_df, by = join_by(name))
```
